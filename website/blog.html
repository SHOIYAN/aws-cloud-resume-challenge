      <h1> <strong>The Cloud Resume Challenge</strong></h1><hr>
      <p>I found this challenge on r/AWSCertifications after passing my CSAA test exam. I saw it as a fantastic opportunity to gain practical experience with AWS and enhance my resume. While some of the steps initially seemed daunting and unfamiliar, I thoroughly enjoyed the process of researching and overcoming any obstacles I encountered. This often involved diving deep into documentation for various AWS services. Without further ado, let's delve into how I approached each step.

      </p>
    
      <h1>My AWS Journey: Creating a Website</h1>
      <p>I began by discovering a basic HTML template that caught my eye online. You can find one on <a href="https://www.free-css.com/template-categories/blog" target="_blank">www.free-css.com</a>. It included a CSS stylesheet that complemented the design. While I used the template as a starting point, I made several adjustments to the CSS and HTML to align with my website's existing style, which was established prior to this project. Eventually, I switched to using Bootstrap, as it simplified the process of customizing my resume to match my website. Despite the template's initial appeal, it became cumbersome to work with due to the extensive modifications I had to make. Looking back, I wish I had opted to create my design from scratch, given the amount of tweaking required.</p>
      
      <h2>Establishing the Frontend</h2>
      <p>My next step was setting up an AWS account. I began by using S3, where I initially created a bucket to gain familiarity with the service. Once confident, I set up my actual S3 bucket and hosted my frontend content as a static website. Following this, I purchased a domain name (shoiyan.com) through Route53. After acquiring the domain, I utilized Amazon Certificate Manager to secure the site with the necessary certificates. With the certificates in place, I employed Amazon CloudFront to enhance the site's security (over HTTPS).</p>
      
      <h2>Configuring the Backend</h2>
      <p>I dedicated several days to exploring AWS IAM, Lambda, DynamoDB, and API Gateway. This exploration served as an educational experience, providing me with a deeper understanding of these services and their functionalities. Once comfortable, I implemented a visitor count feature for my frontend to track site visitors. Initially, I created these resources manually through the console, which led to encountering numerous errors. I first had to determine the best approach for storing visitor counts in DynamoDB, ultimately opting for a simple read and write strategy for the same record. I utilized Lambda to develop the necessary code for reading from and writing to the DynamoDB table. Although it took a few days, I eventually succeeded in getting this functionality to work. Additionally, I used pytest to create Python tests, which checked for a successful response.</p>
      
      <h2>Connecting the Components</h2>
      <p>After ensuring my Lambda function, DynamoDB table, and API Gateway were interoperable, I proceeded to write the JavaScript required to display the visitor count. The workflow involved Frontend -> API Gateway -> Lambda -> DynamoDB. Upon achieving JavaScript functionality to update the screen by calling the API, I encountered a CORS error. I resolved this by researching various error messages and solutions online, ultimately rectifying the issue by enabling CORS in API Gateway and ensuring Lambda returned an appropriate response.</p>
      
      <h2>Infrastructure as Code (IAC)</h2>
      <p>With the frontend and backend functioning smoothly, I turned my attention to using Terraform to deploy the necessary resources as infrastructure as code. This was a particularly enjoyable aspect of the project, as Terraform simplified the deployment process. Despite deploying a practice project first to familiarize myself with Terraform and avoid potential mistakes with my working web app, I encountered several challenges. YAML indentation proved to be one of the most challenging aspects of deployment. Although Terraform generated much of the initial code, understanding it was crucial for adding additional resources, such as a DynamoDB table. Despite encountering numerous errors during this process, I persisted and eventually succeeded. Having the project as infrastructure as code enabled me to create and delete resources as needed, highlighting the true utility of IAC.</p>
      
      <h2>CI/CD</h2>
      <p>Once the project was fully functional, I utilized GitHub Actions to establish continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD). Despite having multiple projects hosted on GitHub, I had no prior experience with GitHub Actions. I began by reading GitHub's documentation to understand the setup process. Following the documentation, I configured my backend to redeploy upon successful test completion. Additionally, I automated the deployment of my frontend GitHub repository to push changes to S3. This automation proved invaluable, particularly for someone like me who enjoys frequent updates to their website. This streamlined process allowed me to make changes locally, commit them to GitHub, and see them live on my site.</p>
      
      <h2>Achieving Certification</h2>
      <p>After successfully passing the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner (CCP) and AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate (CSA) exams, I integrated my newly acquired skills into the Cloud Resume Challenge. This project was both enjoyable and educational, providing me with skills that I will continue to refine. I highly recommend this challenge to anyone learning to code or seeking to expand their knowledge in cloud development. If you have any recommendations on a project I should try please leave a comment letting me know!.</p>
