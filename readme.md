## Cloud Resume Challenge

This project showcases my ability to build and deploy cloud infrastructure using modern cloud services. The Cloud Resume Challenge involves creating a static resume website hosted on cloud infrastructure with serverless components.

### Key Features:
- **Static Website:** A personal resume website deployed on cloud infrastructure.
